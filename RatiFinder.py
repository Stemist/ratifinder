''' Function: read_file(file_name, item_type)
Parameters: file_name - the name of the file to be read.
            item_type - user-inputted search term to specify what is parsed for in the document.
            os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))+"\\" is the current working directory.

Returns:    parsed_data_list - A list of parsed data (strings) from the parsed text documents.
                               This list will be used to append the item_type_master_list to be written to a .txt file.

Desc: Function intended to read files and return a list (parsed_data_list) of text lines starting at the search
keyword and ending at the end of the line.

The function creates an object (doc) which is defined by the contents of the document's paragraphs,
then creates an empty list (parsed_data_list). For loop looks through each line inside (doc) for search word (item_type)
specified by the user.

If item_type found, prints a string from the start of the line item_type was found on to the end of the length of the 
line that item_type exists on and appends the parsed_data_list with it.
